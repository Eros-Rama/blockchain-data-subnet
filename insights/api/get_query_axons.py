    Pings a list of UIDs to check their availability on the Bittensor network.

    Args:
        dendrite (bittensor.dendrite): The dendrite instance to use for pinging nodes.
        metagraph (bittensor.metagraph): The metagraph instance containing network information.
        uids (list): A list of UIDs (unique identifiers) to ping.
        timeout (int, optional): The timeout in seconds for each ping. Defaults to 3.
